1.  Select the element that contains the profile image.
Change the src attribute so it points to a picture of
your choosing instead.

  => profile = document.querySelector('.profile-image')
  => profile.src = "images/clouds-man.jpg"

2.  Use the same approach to select the element that
contains the photo of the sky and change the src
attribute to another picture URL of your choosing.

  => leftImage = document.querySelector('#left-image.portfolio-image img')
  => leftImage.src = "images/pikachu-drawing.jpg"

3.  Select the heading that says "Panda the Bear" and
change it to your own name.

  => heading = document.querySelector('h1.highlight')
  => heading.innerText = 'Don Cooper'

4.  Select the heading that says "Employment" and change
it to something else.

  => employment = document.querySelector('#employment h3.info-title')
  => employment.innerText = 'Napping'
